# My Trivia Quiz Site

I built this website to showcase my reactjs skills and also to implement routes on the website with react router dom library



## Demo

- [Trivia](https://kaushalluffa.github.io/trivia)

## STACK

#### Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, SCSS, ReactJS

#### Third party libraries used

For the fonts Google Fonts and for the animations AnimeJs is used. Another library from react is used for routing which react-router-dom


## Lessons Learned

I learnt how to utilize state to conditinally render components on the screen and also how to manage it.
In beginning I had trouble fetching and saving data but then I figured how to properly save fetched data in state to then render it on screen.

In local development environment I was able to use the routing but as soon as I pushed the code to Github Pages it stopped working and the I had to do some research about it and in the last I was able to fix it and now it works.

My next challenges are to give the user options as following:

1. Choose category of questions
2. Choose difficulty level of questions
3. Enter their name and save the progress first in browser local storage
4. After implementing above features then save progress in some database.
